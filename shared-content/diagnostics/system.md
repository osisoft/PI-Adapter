# System

The `Diagnostics.System` dynamic type includes the following values which are logged in a stream with the `Id` `System.Diagnostics`.
This diagnostic stream contains system level information related to the host platform that the adapter is running on.

| Property                            | Type       | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **timestamp**                         | `string` | Timestamp of event                                                                |
| **ProcessIdentifier**                 | `int`    | Process Id of the host process                                                    |
| **StartTime**                         | `string` | Time at which the host process started                                            |
| **WorkingSet**                        | `long`   | Amount of physical memory in bytes, allocated for the host process                |
| **TotalProcessorTime**        | `double` | Total processor time for the host process expressed in seconds |
| **TotalUserProcessorTime**    | `double` | User processor time for the host process expressed in seconds                     |
| **TotalPrivilegedProcessorTime** | `double` | Privileged processor time for the host process expressed in seconds               |
| **ThreadCount**                       | `int`    | Number of threads in the host process                                             |
| **HandleCount**                       | `int`    | Number of handles opened by the host process                                      |
| **ManagedMemorySize**        | `double` | Number of bytes currently thought to be allocated in managed memory<br>Unit of Measure = megabytes |
| **PrivateMemorySize**        | `double` | Amount of paged memory in bytes allocated for the host process<br/>Unit of Measure = megabytes |
| **PeakPagedMemorySize**      | `double` | Maximum amount of memory in the virtual memory paging file in bytes used by the host process.<br/>Unit of Measure = megabytes |
| **StorageTotalSize**         | `double` | Total size of the storage medium in use by the system<br/>Unit of Measure = megabytes |
| **StorageFreeSpace**         | `double` | Free space available<br/>Unit of Measure = megabytes                              |

Each adapter component produces its own diagnostics streams.
