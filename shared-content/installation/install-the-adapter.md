# Install the adapter

You can install adapters on either a Windows or Linux operating system. Before installing the adapter, see the respective system requirements to ensure your machine is properly configured to provide optimum adapter operation.

## Windows

Complete the following steps to install a PI adapter on a Windows computer:

1. Download the Windows .msi file from the [OSIsoft Customer portal (https://customers.osisoft.com/s/products)](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/products).

    **Note:** Customer login credentials are required to access the portal.

2. Run the .msi file.

3. Follow the setup wizard.

    You can change the installation folder or port number during setup. The default port number is `5590`.

4. Optional: To verify the installation, run the following `curl` command with the port number that you specified during installation:

    ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration
   ```

   If you receive an error, wait a few seconds and try the script again. If the installation was successful, a JSON copy of the default system configuration is returned.

Complete the following steps to install a PI adapter on a Linux computer:

1. Download the appropriate Linux distribution file from the [OSIsoft Customer portal (https://customers.osisoft.com/s/products)](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/products).
