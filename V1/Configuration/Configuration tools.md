# Configuration tools

OSIsoft adapters can be configured with either the EdgeCmd utility, OSIsoft's proprietary tool for configuring adapters, or a commonly used REST tool.

## EdgeCmd utility

The EdgeCmd utility enables adapter configuration on both Linux and Windows operating systems. For more information on using the EdgeCmd utility, see the [EdgeCmd utility documentation (https://osisoft.github.io/Edgecmd-Docs/V1.1/EdgeCmd_utility_1-1.html)](https://osisoft.github.io/Edgecmd-Docs/V1.1/EdgeCmd_utility_1-1.html).

## REST tools

The following tools are available to make REST calls.

### curl

curl is a command line tool used to make HTTP calls and is supported on both Windows and Linux operating systems. curl is easily scripted using Bash or PowerShell on either Linux or Windows, and can be used to perform adapter administrative and programming tasks. curl commands are used in configuration and management examples throughout this document. For more information, see [curl (https://curl.haxx.se/)](https://curl.haxx.se/).

### Postman

Postman is a REST tool for systems with GUI components. OSIsoft adapters are supported on platforms without GUIs. Postman is particularly useful for learning more about OSIsoft adapter REST APIs. For more information, see [Postman (https://www.postman.com/)](https://www.postman.com/).
