    **Note:** The configuration, data, and log files are not removed by the uninstall process.

2. Optional: To remove data, configuration and log files, remove the directory _%ProgramData%\OSIsoft\Adapters\AdapterName_.

    This will delete all data processed by the adapter in addition to configuration and log files.

    ```

2. Optional: To remove data, configuration, and log files, remove the directory _/usr/share/OSIsoft/Adapters/AdapterName_.

    This will delete all data processed  by the adapter, in addition to configuration and log files.

    Alternatively, you can run the following command:
